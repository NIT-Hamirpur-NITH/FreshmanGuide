## Demo
The project is hosted [Here](https://glug.nith.ac.in/freshman)

## Installations
To setup the development environment for the project, follow the instructions given below.

First of all, you need to install [Laravel](https://laravel.com) to run this project on your localhost.

Installation of Laravel
------------------------

* **First get PHP and all its extension laravel depends on**

> PHP >= 5.5.9, OpenSSL PHP Extension, PDO PHP Extension, Mbstring PHP, Extension, Tokenizer PHP Extension

On Ubuntu you can get them by using,
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php php-mysql php-mcrypt php-curl php-mbstring php-gettext php-zip
sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client
```

* **Then install Composer (PHP's dependencies manager). Depending on you OS you can get it from [Donwload Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)**

On Ubuntu the best way to gloabally install composer is,
```
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
or if you want to use curl,
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```
Now `composer` will be availabe to you as a command.

* **Clone this repository, enter the project's directory and install all dependencies using composer**
```
composer install
```

* **Make a `mysql` database**
```
 mysql -u <username> -p
 create database database_name;
 Ctrl + C
```

* **Generate the key**

Before running the project, you need to generate an application key for your clone of the project. Rename .env.example file to .env and then generate the key by running the following commands:
```
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
Open the file in any editor and make the changes in the following lines

```
DB_DATABASE=<database_name>
DB_USERNAME=<username>
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
```
* **Migrate the database**
```
php artisan migrate
```

* **Now, you are ready to run the website on your localhost**
```
php artisan serve
```
